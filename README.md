# Killall for Microsoft Windows
This is a basic implementation of the killall command for Microsoft Windows.

The killall command on Unix-like operating systems is used to terminate running processes based on their name.
Unlike the kill command, which requires a process ID (PID) to terminate a single process, killall can terminate all processes that match the name provided as an argument. This makes it particularly useful for stopping multiple instances of a process at once.


The basic syntax of the killall command is as follows:

``` sh
killall process_name
```

Where process_name is the name of the process you want to kill.
